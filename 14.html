          <p>I wasn't sure if I should send this since we're no contact, 
            but I already wrote this code and I don't wanna waste it. 
            I respect that you wanted space (no expectations, no chasing).   
          </p>
          <p>
            Idk what the future holds and I'm not forcing anything beyond that. 
            If we find our way back to each other, fine. If we don't, that's fine too. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope you're doing okay and taking care of yourself.
